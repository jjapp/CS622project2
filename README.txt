# Perceptron

* One helper function iterate(x,y,w,b) that completes an iteration of the perceptron algorithm.
* Perceptron runs a while loop until the weights at the beginning of the loop equal the weights at the end.
* After this point it exits and returns the weights and b

# Test Perceptron

* Uses the weights and bias to classify the data and compare it to the actual values.
* Returns result as the percent correct predictions.

# Gradient Descent

* Calculate max value in the gradient.
* While the max value is greater than 0.0001 the function continues calculating new values for x until the max gradient is
less than 0.0001.
